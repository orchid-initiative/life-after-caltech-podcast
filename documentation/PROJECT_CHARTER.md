# Project Charter: Life After Caltech Podcast

## Executive Summary
The Life After Caltech Podcast is an unofficial student–alumni interview series sharing authentic stories of life beyond Caltech. Its purpose is to provide current students with hope, perspective, and connection by highlighting diverse post-graduation paths.

## Project Goals
- Produce and release a first season of 6–8 podcast episodes.  
- Provide transcripts, show notes, and short promotional blurbs for each episode.  
- Establish a sustainable volunteer workflow for editing, transcription, and outreach.  
- Document the process so future student and alumni teams can continue the project.

## Deliverables
- Season 1 podcast episodes (audio + transcripts).  
- Written episode descriptions and show notes.  
- Public-facing README and documentation (this repo).  
- A closeout report at the end of Season 1.

## Business Case / Background

**Why are we doing this?**
